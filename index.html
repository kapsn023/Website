                    My name is Emmett Kapsner and I recently graduated from the 
                    University of Minnesota with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science
                    and a minor in German. My studies focused heavily on computer graphics
                    and human
                    computer interaction. This involved creating everything from a 
                    feature-complete ray tracer from scratch in C and C++ to implementing
                    a novel interaction technique in VR using the Godot game engine.
                    This experience has taught me a wide variety of technical skills
                    and how to adapt to challenging circumstances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though I primarily focused on computer graphics and human-computer
                    interaction, my interests in computing are broad. I gravitate towards
                    any niches within software development that requires interesting 
                    decisions to be made and trade-offs to be weighed. For example, 
                    the design and implementation of computer graphics often consist of a
                    balancing act between appearences and performance. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am proficient in many programming languages.
                    These include, but are not limited to, C, C++, Java, and Python. I also
                    have some experience with Javascript/Typescript, HTML, GLSL, and C#.
                    I am always trying to learn new skills and languages. This website has
                    been an attempt to apply HTML and CSS and it is still very much a 
                    work-in-progress. I plan on adding some Javascript functionality once
                    I find an excuse to.
