                        This page serves as a collection of all of my past projects 
                        that are either too old to deserve a dedicated page or I simply 
                        do not have enough to say about them for a whole page. That being 
                        said, I still vouch for these projects, some of which I am still 
                        actively working on.

                    <h3>Website</h3>
                    <p>
                        This website has been a great learning experience for me and will 
                        hopefully continue to be. Before starting on it, I knew practically
                        no HTML or CSS, but I sought to remedy this. I wanted to create 
                        a website that was simple and functional, but it would also ideally
                        look pleasing. I believe I've achieved these aims, but there is
                        still more I would like to add. I would like to experiment with 
                        Javascipt and I plan on adding some functionality that requires it.

                    <h3>Cloth Simulation</h3>

                    </video>

                    <p>
                        This is a simple cloth simulation that I made from scratch in 
                        Processing. At its core, it is simply made up of multiple 
                        simulated ropes that are linked to one another. Each node in the 
                        cloth has collision with other objects but not with other nodes. 
                        The simulation is relatively fast because it ignores potential
                        stretching of the cloth. Instead, it relies on constrained 
                        dynamics between the nodes. After each computational cycle, the 
                        simulation will try to keep every node within the required distance.
                        It is not perfect when using smaller sub-steps, so it can result in
                        some visible stretching. If some stretching is preferred stylistically,
                        this can be kept.

                    <h3>Inverse Kinematics</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is a simple one arm inverse kinematics simulation that I made in
                        Processing. The skeleton is able to re-root and switch between two roots.
                        This enables the skeleton to walk across the screen. Joint limits were
                        also implemented. This is done by simply clamping the angles of each node
                        after every update. Object collisions were also implemented. The skeleton
                        is unable to go through obstacles and instead wraps around them. In this
                        implementation, only sphere are present as obstacles, but this could
                        easily be expanded to other shapes.
