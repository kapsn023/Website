                        Here are images from a ray tracer that I made independently and
                        completely from scratch in C. No libraries were used. It 
                        implements a version of the Blinn-Phong reflection model. It is
                        able to display both sphere and triangles. These can be textured,
                        reflective and opaque or transparent. It naturally supports
                        both point and directional lights. Spotlights were not included,
                        but this could be added by simply ignoring the influence of 
                        lights if the ray comes from an angle that is too large.

                        The GitHub link to the code for this is coming soon. This project 
                        was completed in a very short period of time, and it needs to be 
                        clean up substantially.

                        This image depicts a very reflective sphere within a larger textured
                        sphere. This was done by simply shooting another ray from each ray 
                        sphere intersection and retrieving color information from the second
                        ray. This second ray can then go onto create other rays if it hits 
                        another object that is either reflective or transparent. The limit
                        to the recursion can be modified.

                        There are two important secondary rays in work for each primary ray.
                        When a primary ray hits an object, it creates two new rays. One 
                        reflects off of the object if the object is reflective and the other
                        goes into the object if it is transparent. The path of the secondary
                        ray that goes into the object is bent according to the normals of 
                        said objects. Both of the secondary rays gather more color 
                        information from any collisions and report weighted versions of
                        these colors back to the original ray.

                        The ray tracer is capable of both smooth and flat shading for faces.
                        This is decided on a per face level. Each vertex contains information
                        for position, but also its normal. The flat shading assumes that the 
                        face's normal is to be used for each of it's pixels. Smooth shading, 
                        on the other hand, uses that normal stored in each of the vertices 
                        and interpolates between them in order to create that smooth
                        appearence.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Both of these shading techniques 
                        serve different purposes. Flat shading makes sense as kind of a 
                        default; it serves as a great starting point and works great for 
                        any boxy shapes, such as cubes or prisms. However if one wanted to 
                        use it for a curved shape, it would take a significant amount of
                        polygons to make it look natural. This is where smooth shading comes 
                        into play. This type of shading allows one to seemlessly give the 
                        illusion of a curved surface, even if the shape is made up solely 
                        of flat faces. This type of shading is less of a necessity in this 
                        ray tracers, as spheres are fully supported, but it would still be 
                        helpful for other curved shapes such as cylinders.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The picture on the left is not the best showcase of smooth shading's 
                        potential advantages, and I would like to add a better picture for 
                        that soon.

                    <h3>
                        Possible Future Extensions
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        There a lot of potential directions I could take this project. The 
                        biggest addition that I have plans for in the near future is to add 
                        model importing. This would allow me to better illustrate the 
                        capabilities of my ray tracer. Right now, each piece of geometry 
                        has to be painstakingly placed into the virtual environment by hand.
                        All of the coordinates and material properties have to be explicitly 
                        defined for each piece. Model importing would substantially hasten 
                        this process. I believe that this ray tracer is quite powerful and 
                        I would like the ability to fully demostrate this. This one change 
                        would have the greatest impact on the rest of the project.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It would also be interesting to add the ability to natively display 
                        cylinders. Currently, a cylinder would have to be made of triangles, 
                        which does not take full advantage of the capabilities of ray tracers.
                        It would also involve a lot of interesting and difficult math. 
                        Cylinders are significantly more difficult to show than mere triangles 
                        or spheres. It would definitely prove to be an intersting challenge. 
                    </p>
