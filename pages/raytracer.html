                <section>
                
                    <p>
                        Here are images from a ray tracer that I made independently and
                        completely from scratch in C. No libraries were used. It 
                        implements a version of the Blinn-Phong reflection model. It is
                        able to display both sphere and triangles. These can be textured,
                        reflective and opaque or transparent. It naturally supports
                        both point and directional lights. Spotlights were not included,
                        but this could be added by simply ignoring the influence of 
                        lights if the ray comes from an angle that is too large.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Ray tracers work by shooting a vector, which are called rays in
                        this context, into an environment filled by geometric shapes. For 
                        a single ray and shape, the collision detection is relatively fast 
                        and cheap. On collision, if the object struck is transparent and/or 
                        reflective, than one or more rays are then spawned from the point 
                        of collision. The departing angle for these rays are dependent on 
                        the normal at the point of collision and the direction from which 
                        the original ray came. The process of ray spawning more rays could 
                        go on forever, but a limit is set. Once the rays reach this limit or 
                        are no longer colliding, then color information is ray to its 
                        origin ray until the stream of information makes it back to the 
                        camera and a pixel is colored.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Lights in this ray tracer are modelled imperfectly but efficiently. 
                        In this version of ray tracing, rays do not come from light sources, 
                        but rather the camera itself. This is less realistic but generally 
                        more efficient. In order to make shadows look somewhat realistic,
                        a new ray is shot from a collision point to each and every light 
                        source to check for any objects that would block light from the 
                        collision point. This ray tracer is smart enough to take into 
                        account transperency; if an object is at least partially transparent,
                        it will allow a corresponding amount of light through. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The GitHub link to the code for this is coming soon. This project 
                        was completed in a very short period of time, and it needs to be 
                        clean up substantially.

                        Reflection and Texturing of Spheres

                        This image depicts a very reflective sphere within a larger textured
                        sphere. Though it may look like it, the smaller sphere in the center 
                        of the image has no texture. What looks to be a texture is simply 
                        the reflection of the larger sphere around it. 
                    </p>

                    <p> 
                        The way this is done is relatively simple. When a ray hits the smaller
                        sphere, no color information is directly imparted on the ray, as the 
                        sphere is totally reflective. Instead, a second sphere is spawn and is 
                        sent off in a direction that is the dictated by the normal vector and 
                        the angle that the original ray impacted the sphere. This second ray 
                        then collides with the larger sphere. The color information from the 
                        texture on the larger sphere is imparted onto the ray, which then 
                        gives that information to the first ray. From first ray's color 
                        information, the camera is able to determine what color to make the 
                        corresponding pixel. This process is done for every pixel in the image.

                        There are two important secondary rays in work for each primary ray.
                        When a primary ray hits an object, it creates two new rays. One 
                        reflects off of the object if the object is reflective and the other
                        goes into the object if it is transparent. The path of the secondary
                        ray that goes into the object is bent according to the normals of 
                        said objects. Both of the secondary rays gather more color 
                        information from any collisions and report weighted versions of
                        these colors back to the original ray. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The color information from any secondary rays is weighted by how 
                        reflective or transparent the original object is. This can be seen 
                        well by how the shadows on the map differ from one another. Depending 
                        on the transperency of the spheres above, the corresponding shadow 
                        will block more or less light from the light source above.

                    <p>
                        The ray tracer is capable of both smooth and flat shading for faces.
                        This is decided on a per face level. Each vertex contains information
                        for position, but also its normal. The flat shading assumes that the 
                        face's normal is to be used for each of it's pixels. Smooth shading, 
                        on the other hand, uses that normal stored in each of the vertices 
                        and interpolates between them in order to create that smooth
                        appearence.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Both of these shading techniques 
                        serve different purposes. Flat shading makes sense as kind of a 
                        default; it serves as a great starting point and works great for 
                        any boxy shapes, such as cubes or prisms. However if one wanted to 
                        use it for a curved shape, it would take a significant amount of
                        polygons to make it look natural. This is where smooth shading comes 
                        into play. This type of shading allows one to seemlessly give the 
                        illusion of a curved surface, even if the shape is made up solely 
                        of flat faces. This type of shading is less of a necessity in this 
                        ray tracers, as spheres are fully supported, but it would still be 
                        helpful for other curved shapes such as cylinders.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The picture on the left is not the best showcase of smooth shading's 
                        potential advantages, and I would like to add a better picture for 
                        that soon.

                    <h3>
                        Possible Future Extensions
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        There a lot of potential directions I could take this project. The 
                        biggest addition that I have plans for in the near future is to add 
                        model importing. This would allow me to better illustrate the 
                        capabilities of my ray tracer. Right now, each piece of geometry 
                        has to be painstakingly placed into the virtual environment by hand.
                        All of the coordinates and material properties have to be explicitly 
                        defined for each piece. Model importing would substantially hasten 
                        this process. I believe that this ray tracer is quite powerful and 
                        I would like the ability to fully demostrate this. This one change 
                        would have the greatest impact on the rest of the project.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It would also be interesting to add the ability to natively display 
                        cylinders. Currently, a cylinder would have to be made of triangles, 
                        which does not take full advantage of the capabilities of ray tracers.
                        It would also involve a lot of interesting and difficult math. 
                        Cylinders are significantly more difficult to show than mere triangles 
                        or spheres. It would definitely prove to be an intersting challenge. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The biggest and most ambitious thing I would like to try is to port 
                        this ray tracer over to the GPU. Currently, it runs completely on the 
                        CPU without any mutlithreading. Because of this, it can often take 
                        multiple seconds to get an image. This port should be able to keep 
                        a lot of the same structure as the orginal ray tracer, but I would 
                        have to take into account the differing advantages and limitations 
                        of GPUs. My intention is to write it in GLSL as that is the 
                        shading language that I know the best.
