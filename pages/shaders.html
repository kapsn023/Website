                    <p>
                        The pictures above are from GLSL shaders I made for one of my graphic
                        classes. The one of the far left is a Gouraud shader and the one in
                        the middle is a Phong shader. These two are classics and have a lot in common.
                        The chief difference between the two is that they calculate the normals
                        at different points in the graphics pipeline. A Gouraud shader will 
                        calculate the normals only at the vertices and then interpolate between 
                        them for each pixel. Because of this, Gouraud shaders will often produce
                        blocky shading, which can be seen above, especially when comparing it
                        to the Phong shader to its right.
                        Phong shaders, on the other hand, calculate the 
                        normal for every pixel. Thus, the Phong shaders will generally look
                        much better, but are more expensive. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This difference can been seen in the shading code itself. Here, two shaders
                        go into actually creating each of the final images; we have vertex and 
                        fragment shaders. The vertex shaders are for calculations at the vertex level
                        and fragment shaders are for computations at the pixel level. For the Gouraud,
                        it's plain to see that the vertex shader is substantially more complex than
                        the fragment shader, and this makes sense, as the vertex shader is resposnible
                        for all of the normal calculations. For the Phong shader, this is reversed and
                        the fragment shader does all of the normal calculations. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The right-most image is from a "Toon" shader, which is an extension of the Phong
                        shader. The crisp division between the shades of red is produced by using a 
                        ramp to round the pixel colors to one of four. The black outline is produced 
                        by a seperate set of shaders. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These pictures above are from two attempts at trying to produce a stable 
                        dithering shader. They are both extensions of Phong shading. The aim is 
                        to produce a greyscale image with the use of only black and white. This 
                        can be achieved by placing black and white pixels in proportion with the 
                        shade of grey that is to be produced. They both use a matrix to coordinate
                        the placement of these pixels. The only substantial difference between these
                        two is how the position of the current pixel is calculated (as pixels can 
                        not communicate with one another). The image on the left uses a haphazard 
                        means of getting the pixel position and does not produce a stable image.
                        I did not know at the time that  
                        pixel position is readily-availible. The second shader uses the correct 
                        pixel position and the shading effect is therefore stable. That being said,
                        I almost prefer how the original shader looks. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For a future exploration, I
                        would like to find a middle ground between the two. I like the roughness 
                        of the original and the stability of the second version. This may be achieveable
                        with a larger matrix. I'll have to run some tests to fine tune it.  
                        I would also like to produce a version of this shader that is even less 
                        stable. The original shader's pixels only shift when the object is rotated.
                        If it is stationary, then the pixels are stationary. I think it would look 
                        really interesting if the pixels were always shifting (almost randomly) but
                        the general shading still remains consistent. I have a couple of ideas on 
                        how to achieve this, but I have not tried them (yet).
                    </p>
