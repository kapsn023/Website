                <p>
                    The gods had condemned Sisyphus to ceaselessly rolling a rock up to the top of a
                    mountain, whence the stone would fall back of its own weight. They had thought with
                    some reason that there is no more dreadful punishment the futile and hopeless labor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If one believes Homer, Sisyphus was the wisest and most prudent of mortals.
                    According to another tradition, however, he was disposed to practice the profession of
                    highwayman. I see no contradiction in this. Opinions differ as to why he became the
                    futile laborer of the underworld. To begin with, he is accused of a certain levity in
                    regard to the gods. He stole their secrets. Ӕgina, the daughter of Ӕsopus, was carried
                    off by Jupiter. The father was shocked by that disappearance and complained to
                    Sisyphus. He, who knew of the abduction, offered to tell about it on condition that
                    Ӕsopus would give water to the citadel of Corinth. To the celestial thunderbolts he
                    preferred the benediction of water. He was punished for this in the underworld.
                    Homer tells us also that Sisyphus had put death in chains. Pluto could not endure the
                    sight of his deserted, silent empire. He dispatched the god of war, who liberated Death
                    from the hands of her conqueror.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is said also that Sisyphus, being near death, rashly wanted to test his wife's love. He
                    ordered her to cast his unburied body into the middle of the public square. Sisyphus
                    woke up in the underworld. And there, annoyed by an obedience so contrary to human
                    love, he obtained from Pluto permission to return to earth in order to chastise his wife.
                    But when he had seen again the face of this world, enjoyed water and sun, warm
                    stones and the sea, he no longer wanted to go back to the infernal darkness. Recalls,
                    signs of anger, warnings were of no avail. Many years more he lived facing the curve
                    of the gulf, the sparkling sea, and the smiles of earth. A decree of the gods was
                    necessary. Mercury came and seized the impudent man by the collar and, snatching him 
                    from his joys, led him forcibly back to the underworld, where his rock was ready
                    for him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You have already grasped that Sisyphus is the absurd hero. He is as much so through
                    his passions as through his torture. His scorn of the gods, his hatred of death, and his
                    passion for life won him that unspeakable penalty in which the whole being is exerted
                    toward accomplishing nothing. This is the price that must be paid for the passions of
                    this earth. Nothing is told us about Sisyphus in the underworld. Myths are made for
                    the imagination to breathe life into them. As for this myth, one sees merely the whole
                    effort of a body straining to raise the huge stone, to roll it and push it up a slope a
                    hundred times over; one sees the face screwed up, the cheek tight against the stone,
                    the shoulder bracing the clay-covered mass, the foot wedging it, the fresh start with
                    arms outstretched, the wholly human security of two earth-clotted hands. At the very
                    end of his long effort measured by skyless space and time without depth, the purpose
                    is achieved. Then Sisyphus watches the stone rush down in a few moments toward
                    that lower world whence he will have to push it up again toward the summit. He goes
                    back down to the plain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is during that return, that pause, that Sisyphus interests me. A face that toils so close
                    to stones is already stone itself! I see that man going back down with a heavy, yet
                    measured step toward the torment of which he will never know the end. That hour like
                    a breathing-space which returns as surely as his suffering, that is the hour of
                    consciousness. At each of those moments when he leaves the heights and gradually
                    sinks toward the lairs of the gods, he is superior to his fate. He is stronger than his
                    rock.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If this myth is tragic, that is because its hero is conscious. Where would his torture be,
                    indeed, if at every step the hope of succeeding upheld him? The workman of today
                    works every day in his life at the same tasks, and this fate is no less absurd. But it is
                    tragic only at the rare moments when it becomes conscious. Sisyphus, proletarian of
                    the gods, powerless and rebellious, knows the whole extent of his wretched condition:
                    it is what he thinks of during his descent. The lucidity that was to constitute his torture
                    at the same time crowns his victory. There is no fate that cannot be surmounted by
                    scorn.

                    If the descent is thus sometimes performed in sorrow, it can also take place in joy.
                    This word is not too much. Again I fancy Sisyphus returning toward his rock, and the
                    sorrow was in the beginning. When the images of earth cling too tightly to memory,
                    when the call of happiness becomes too insistent, it happens that melancholy rises in
                    man's heart: this is the rock's victory, this is the rock itself. The boundless grief is too
                    heavy to bear. These are our nights of Gethsemane. But crushing truths perish from
                    being acknowledged. Thus, Œdipus at the outset obeys fate without knowing it. But
                    from the moment he knows, his tragedy begins. Yet at the same moment, blind and
                    desperate, he realizes that the only bond linking him to the world is the cool hand of a
                    girl. Then a tremendous remark rings out: "Despite so many ordeals, my advanced age
                    and the nobility of my soul make me conclude that all is well." Sophocles' Œdipus,
                    like Dostoevsky's Kirilov, thus gives the recipe for the absurd victory. Ancient
                    wisdom confirms modern heroism
                </p>
                <p>
                    One does not discover the absurd without being tempted to write a manual of
                    happiness. "What! by such narrow ways--?" There is but one world, however.
                    Happiness and the absurd are two sons of the same earth. They are inseparable. It
                    would be a mistake to say that happiness necessarily springs from the absurd
                    discovery. It happens as well that the feeling of the absurd springs from happiness. "I
                    conclude that all is well," says Œdipus, and that remark is sacred. It echoes in the wild
                    and limited universe of man. It teaches that all is not, has not been, exhausted. It
                    drives out of this world a god who had come into it with dissatisfaction and a
                    preference for futile sufferings. It makes of fate a human matter, which must be settled
                    among men.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All Sisyphus' silent joy is contained therein. His fate belongs to him. His rock is his
                    thing. Likewise, the absurd man, when he contemplates his torment, silences all the
                    idols. In the universe suddenly restored to its silence, the myriad wondering little
                    voices of the earth rise up. Unconscious, secret calls, invitations from all the faces,
                    they are the necessary reverse and price of victory. There is no sun without shadow,
                    and it is essential to know the night. The absurd man says yes and his effort will
                    henceforth be unceasing. If there is a personal fate, there is no higher destiny, or at
                    least there is but one which he concludes is inevitable and despicable. For the rest, he
                    knows himself to be the master of his days. At that subtle moment when man glances
                    backward over his life, Sisyphus returning toward his rock, in that slight pivoting he
                    contemplates that series of unrelated actions which becomes his fate, created by him,
                    combined under his memory's eye and soon sealed by his death. Thus, convinced of
                    the wholly human origin of all that is human, a blind man eager to see who knows that
                    the night has no end, he is still on the go. The rock is still rolling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I leave Sisyphus at the foot of the mountain! One always finds one's burden again. But
                    Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods and raises rocks. He too
                    concludes that all is well. This universe henceforth without a master seems to him
                    neither sterile nor futile. Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night-
                    filled mountain, in itself forms a world. The struggle itself toward the heights is
                    enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.
